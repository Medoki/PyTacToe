# PyTacToe
This is a dumb python tic tac toe, expect bugs and issues. It is in the public domain, feel free to use it as you wish.

#Note 1: The game's interface is in french
#Note 2: There is local multiplayer support
#Note 3: The bot has no strategy and chooses a random number and thus is easy to beat.
